    "If you are using Jupyter Notebook to complete the work, your notebook can be exported as a .py file (File -> Download As -> Python). Your code will be auto-graded using Python 3.6, so please make sure that your code runs. There will be a 15% penalty if you need a remark due to small issues that renders your code untestable. (Please note the penalty is higher than in A1!)\n",
